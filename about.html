<h1>Sports car</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <br>
    <p>Sportscar is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.</p>
    <p>The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.</p>
    <p>Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.</p>
    <p>Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are requisite.</p>
    <p>Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity compared to standard models.</p>
    <p>Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control at high speeds.</p>
    <p>Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coupés also started to become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not absolute.</p>
    
<h1>Definition</h1>
   <hr>
    <p>Attributing the definition of "sports car" to any particular model can be controversial .</p>
    <p>A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.</p>
    <p>Performance modifications of regular, production cars, such as sport compacts, sports sedans, muscle cars, pony cars and hot hatches, </p>
    <p>generally are not considered sports cars, yet share traits common to sports cars. </p>
    <p>Some models are called "sports cars" for marketing purposes to take advantage of greater marketplace acceptance and for promotional purposes.</p>
    <p>High-performance cars of various configurations are grouped as Sports and Grand tourer cars or, occasionally, just as performance cars.</p>
     
<h1>Drivetrain and engine layout</h1>
   <hr>
    <p>The drivetrain and engine layout significantly influences the handling characteristics of an automobile, and is crucially important in the design of a sports car.</p>
    
    <p>The front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (FR) is common to sports cars of any era and has survived longer in sports cars than in mainstream automobiles.</p>
    
    <p>In search of improved handling and weight distribution, other layouts are sometimes used. The rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RMR) is commonly found only in sports cars—the motor is centre-mounted in the chassis (closer to and behind the driver), and powers only the rear wheels. Some high-performance sports car manufacturers, such as Ferrari and Lamborghini have preferred this layout. </p>
           
    <p>Porsche is one of the few remaining manufacturers using the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (RR). The motor's distributed weight across the wheels, in a Porsche 911, provides excellent traction, but the significant mass behind the rear wheels makes it more prone to oversteer in some situations. Porsche has continuously refined the design and in recent years added electonic stability control to counteract these inherent design shortcomings.</p>
            
    <p>The front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout (FF) layout which is the most common in sport compacts and hot hatches, and modern production cars in general, is not generally used for sports cars. This layout is advantageous for small, light, lower power sports cars, as it avoids the extra weight, increased transmission power loss, and packaging problems of a long driveshaft and longitudinal engine of FR vehicles. However, its conservative handling effect, particularly understeer, and the fact that many drivers believe rear wheel drive is a more desirable layout for a sports car count against it.</p>
    
    <p>Before the 1980s few sports cars used four-wheel drive, which had traditionally added a lot of weight. Although not a sports car, the Audi Quattro proved its worth in rallying. With its improvement in traction, particularly in adverse weather conditions, four-wheel drive is no longer uncommon in high-powered sports cars, e.g. Porsche, Lamborghini, and the Bugatti Veyron.
